# Foundations-of-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning
Mini project which applies machine leaning techniques to analyse a real-world data set.
The Immplement several machine learning tasks using the data from "the 2018 freeCodeCamp New Coder Survey". 
- Implement exploratory data analysis and gain an understanding of the data set and
its features.
- Implement cluster analysis and understand the characteristics of new coders in
each cluster.
- Implement classification and build machine learning models for predicting whether
a developer is in high income based on developersâ€™ information.
Note: for new coders in this data set, low income is defined as income less than
$30,000, otherwise, as high-income. Income is provided in the question: "About
how much money did you make last year (in US dollars)?"
All tasks must be implemented through Python programming.
